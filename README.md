# Political opinion mining
Social media users express their views on various subjects using tweets, online comments, blogs and Facebook statusupdates. Mining such data can yield valuable insights into the public sentiment at any given point in time. In this project, we have useduser generated content from Twitter to analyze the upcoming US presidential primaries. Specifically, we studied the public sentimentabout leading democratic presidential candidates on key issues like taxes, healthcare, economy etc. We have extracted tweetsmentioning the candidates, performed sentiment analysis on them, and visualized the evolution of this sentiment over time. Further, wehave used geo-located tweets to break down this analysis by user location. Such analysis will be valuable for political scientists whostudy the evolving political landscape of the country, and for pollsters in improving their statistical models.
